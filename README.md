**Project Title: HomeTech Protection Offer Analysis** (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Data Visualization)

Project Goal: To analyze correlations between initial device inquiry and secondary device ownership, and to evaluate the impact of different probing questions on HomeTech Protection conversion rates through exploratory data analysis with synthetic data.

**Exploratory Data Analysis with Synthetic Data using python**

	• Device Ownership Patterns: 
        What are the most common combinations of secondary devices owned?
        Are there any correlations between the initial device inquiry and the types of secondary devices owned?
	
	• Probing Question Effectiveness: 
        What is the overall conversion rate for HomeTech Protection?
        How do conversion rates vary depending on the probing question used?
